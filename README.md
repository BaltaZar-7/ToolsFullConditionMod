# ToolsFullConditionMod
Mod that sets condition to 100% for looted tool and firemaking items, where condition doesn't have a function anyway.
When you loot these items from containers, in the pick up window it doesn't show 100%, but in your inventory these items should be 100%.
Affected items:  
- Matches (both types)
- Lamp Fuel
- Jerry Can
- Magnifying Lens
- Antiseptic
- Ammo boxes (this one is relevant only, if you have "Reduced Loot" mod installed)
# Installation
Download and place the dll file into your /Mods folder.  
# Thank you for downloading!
Works both for loose and container item spawns.  
You can now trade all the found lamp oil with the trader.  
Shouldn't be too hard to add more items, so let me know if you want some other items included.  
I added Ammo because I use Reduced Loot and while I like the idea to harvest ammo to make perfect ones, you can only harvest one by one, so it's quite tedious. Single cartridges not affected!
