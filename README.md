# ToolsFullConditionMod
Mod that sets condition to 100% for looted tool and firemaking items, where condition doesn't have a function anyway.
Affected items:
- Matches (both types)
- Lamp Fuel
- Jerry Can
- Magnifying Lens
- Antiseptic
- Ammo boxes (this one is relevant only, if you have "Reduced Loot" mod installed)

Works both for loose and container item spawns.
You can now trade all the found lamp oil with the trader.
Shouldn't be too hard to add more items, so let me know if you want some other items included.
Thank you for downloading!
